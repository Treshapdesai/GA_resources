    "The goal of this lesson was to teach you, in general, how hypothesis testing works. We showed you what is probably the most common variety of hypothesis test: the $t$-test. However, there are kajillions of other ones out there. It's not worth our time to go over so many more of them, as they all have the same implementation and interpretation, just in different situations. Instead, here is a list of many of the \"big\" ones and when to use them:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Situation | Common hypothesis test | Example | Notes |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| Testing whether or not one mean is equal to a value | One-sample $t$-test | Do cars on a given road, on average, drive about 65mph? | |\n",
    "| Testing whether or not two means are equal to eachother | Two-sample $t$-test | Is the mean systolic blood pressure of people who receive Medicine A or Medicine B the same? | |\n",
    "| Testing whether or not paired observations have the same value | Paired $t$-test | Among heterosexual married couples, is the husband, on average, taller than the wife? | This is functionally the same as a one-sample $t$-test of the differences |\n",
    "| Testing whether or not three or more means are the same | One-way ANOVA test | Are base salaries upon graduation different for graduates of Penn State, Ohio State, and Michigan? | The ANOVA test has many variants |\n",
    "| Testing whether or not there is a relationship between two categorical variables | $\\chi^2$ test | Is there a relationship between home state and political affiliation? | |\n",
    "| Testing whether or not a given distribution is normally distributed | Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test | Testing whether or not model residuals are normally distributed. Useful for testing linear regression assumptions! | |\n",
    "| Testing whether or not one proportion is equal to a number | One-sample $z$-test | Testing whether or not a coin is fair (ie, testing $P(Heads) = 0.5$) | |\n",
    "| Testing whether or not two proportions are euqal | Two-sample $z$-test | Who is going to win an election? | Testing two or more proportions can be done better with a $\\chi^2$ test |\n",
